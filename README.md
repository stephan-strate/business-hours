This multi-platform library helps to persist, manage, distribute and present business hours using a simple but powerful language. It can handle different timezones and languages with ease. The language covers all kinds of use-cases, as seasons, even/odd weeks, holidays, open-end and much more. If you find one that is not covered, we encourage you to report it or provide a pull-request yourself and become a contributor.
